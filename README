Hello This is where I'll be posting soundpacks for games for different clients. These packs will be for either Tintin++ for different Linux systems (may work on Tintin++for Mac with some work), as well as the client VIPMud for Windows.

All of these packs are licensed under the LGPL. You may modify, distribute, and claim work on these packs, as long as the original author has been credited. I make no claims to any guarantee, warranty, or liability for these packs, as well as it is not my responsibility for lack of sleep due to game play.

If you have any bug reports,feature requests, comments be they good or bad, or possibly game requests, please feel free to email me:
soundpacks at mail dot com
Note: replace "at" with "@" and "dot" with "." to actually send mail. Please include the game, the client, and bug/feature request/comment in the subject line, and the rest in the body of the mail. Something like: "Subject: The Night Bug tintin" would be perfect.

Thank you for visiting this, and using my packs. There will be more to come in the future, as well as additions to this readme.
